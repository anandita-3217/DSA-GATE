# 🌈 The Enchanted Graph Kingdom 🍭

## 🦄 What Are Graphs?
Graphs are magical networks of interconnected nodes (vertices) and connections (edges) - like a mystical web of relationships!

## 🌸 Graph Representation Techniques

### 📦 Adjacency List Representation
```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.graph = {}  # 🍬 Our magical connection map

    def add_vertex(self, vertex):
        """Add a new vertex to the graph"""
        if vertex not in self.graph:
            self.graph[vertex] = []

    def add_edge(self, vertex1, vertex2, weight=1):
        """Add an edge between two vertices"""
        if vertex1 not in self.graph:
            self.add_vertex(vertex1)
        if vertex2 not in self.graph:
            self.add_vertex(vertex2)
        
        self.graph[vertex1].append((vertex2, weight))
        # For undirected graph, uncomment the next line
        # self.graph[vertex2].append((vertex1, weight))
```

### 🌺 Adjacency Matrix Representation
```python
class MatrixGraph:
    def __init__(self, vertices):
        self.vertices = vertices
        self.matrix = [[0] * vertices for _ in range(vertices)]

    def add_edge(self, v1, v2, weight=1):
        """Add an edge between two vertices"""
        self.matrix[v1][v2] = weight
        # For undirected graph, uncomment the next line
        # self.matrix[v2][v1] = weight
```

## 🍭 Graph Traversal Techniques

### 🦄 Depth-First Search (DFS)
```python
def dfs(graph, start, visited=None):
    if visited is None:
        visited = set()
    
    visited.add(start)
    print(start, end=" ")
    
    for neighbor, _ in graph.graph[start]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            dfs(graph, neighbor, visited)
```

### 🌈 Breadth-First Search (BFS)
```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([start])
    visited.add(start)
    
    while queue:
        vertex = queue.popleft()
        print(vertex, end=" ")
        
        for neighbor, _ in graph.graph[vertex]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append(neighbor)
```

## 💖 Shortest Path Algorithms

### 🍦 Dijkstra's Algorithm ⭐
```python
import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, start):
    # Distances from start to all other vertices
    distances = {vertex: float('infinity') for vertex in graph.graph}
    distances[start] = 0
    
    # Priority queue to get minimum distance vertex
    pq = [(0, start)]
    
    # Track visited vertices and previous vertices
    visited = set()
    previous = {vertex: None for vertex in graph.graph}

    while pq:
        current_distance, current_vertex = heapq.heappop(pq)
        
        # If we've found a longer path, skip
        if current_distance > distances[current_vertex]:
            continue
        
        visited.add(current_vertex)
        
        for neighbor, weight in graph.graph[current_vertex]:
            distance = current_distance + weight
            
            # Only consider this path if it's shorter
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                previous[neighbor] = current_vertex
                heapq.heappush(pq, (distance, neighbor))
    
    return distances, previous
```

### 🌺 When to Use Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Finding shortest paths in weighted graphs
- Network routing protocols
- GPS and navigation systems
- Constraints:
  - Only works with non-negative edge weights
  - Cannot handle negative cycles

## 🦄 Other Important Graph Algorithms

### 🍭 Minimum Spanning Tree
#### Kruskal's Algorithm
```python
class DisjointSet:
    def __init__(self, vertices):
        self.parent = {v: v for v in vertices}
        self.rank = {v: 0 for v in vertices}

    def find(self, item):
        if self.parent[item] != item:
            self.parent[item] = self.find(self.parent[item])
        return self.parent[item]

    def union(self, x, y):
        xroot = self.find(x)
        yroot = self.find(y)

        if self.rank[xroot] < self.rank[yroot]:
            self.parent[xroot] = yroot
        elif self.rank[xroot] > self.rank[yroot]:
            self.parent[yroot] = xroot
        else:
            self.parent[yroot] = xroot
            self.rank[xroot] += 1

def kruskal_mst(graph):
    # Sort all edges by weight
    edges = []
    for vertex in graph.graph:
        for neighbor, weight in graph.graph[vertex]:
            edges.append((weight, vertex, neighbor))
    
    edges.sort()
    
    vertices = list(graph.graph.keys())
    disjoint_set = DisjointSet(vertices)
    mst = []

    for weight, u, v in edges:
        if disjoint_set.find(u) != disjoint_set.find(v):
            disjoint_set.union(u, v)
            mst.append((u, v, weight))
    
    return mst
```
